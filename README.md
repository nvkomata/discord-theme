2. other ways
    - you're on your own, i don't care

### why the name?
it's what i cook human meat on, and like, come on, doesn't the theme just remind you of **oil**? <img src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trollface.png" height="22px"> (currently covering myself in it)

to make your own, you're gonna need some stuff

1. base veggie oil theme locked and loaded
2. a template, grab it [here](https://github.com/nvkomata/vegetable-oil/blob/main/colors/test.css)!
3. text editor (i recommend vencord quickcss for this, so you can immediately see your changes)

veggie oil color schemes are 2 sets of variables inside a selector `html:root`, divided by an empty line.

variables for the dark theme are suffixed with `-dark` and light variables with `-light`. simply edit the color codes that come after them to change those theme specific colors!

lastly, when you're done, you can simply leave it as is and use it. or PR it here for others to enjoy. :p
