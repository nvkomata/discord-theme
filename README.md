<summary>...alternatively, here's how to make your own</summary>

---

to make your own, you're gonna need some stuff

1. base theme locked and loaded
2. a template, grab it [here](https://github.com/nvkomata/discord-theme/blob/main/colors/test.css)
3. text editor (i recommend vencord quickcss for this, so you can immediately see your changes)

color schemes are 2 sets of variables inside a selector `html:root`, divided by an empty line.

variables for the dark theme are suffixed with `-dark` and light variables with `-light`. simply edit the color codes that come after them to change those theme specific colors
