### where's industrycatcord?

gone, reduced to atoms.

the original theme is shrimply something i cooked up to play into discord's terrible old ui and give it a little retro webapp aesthetic. since discord has been cooking up a ui refresh that isn't half terrible, i'm not going to bother retheming it (it's too much work anyways).
